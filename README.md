# Colorful (Revisited) for ES-DE
This is port of the Colorful theme (originally by [viking](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/profile/70421-viking/) & [faeran](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/profile/76940-faeran/)) from Launchbox to [ES-DE](https://es-de.org/) v2.x

**Most of the artwork and layouts are designed and created by viking & faeran.  I mainly translated things into the theming engine used by ES-DE and then added artwork for systems that weren't originally part of that theme (see "Credits" below for more details). The original version of the theme can be found [here](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/files/file/2081-colorful-bigbox-theme)**

## Changes Made
- Translated and rewrote all Launchbox specific aspects to make the theme compatible with ES-DE v2.x
- Updated system image names to match the standard used by ES-DE
- Added systems that are supported by ES-DE but not the original launchbox set
- Created images & color schemes for additional systems supported by ES-DE
- Added support for ES-DE capabilities such as badges
- Embedded the ES-DE [system-metadata](https://gitlab.com/es-de/themes/system-metadata) repository to power system description, release year and color details
