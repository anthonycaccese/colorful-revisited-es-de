      <systemDescription>The Atari 7800 Pro System, commonly known as the Atari 7800, is a third generation (1983-2003) video game console developed and distributed by Atari Corporation. It was released in May 1986 in North America at a retail price of $79.95. The console was later released in Europe (1987). The 7800 is considered one of the first backward-compatible consoles as it could play Atari 2600 games without the use of additional modules.
